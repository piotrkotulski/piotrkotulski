I am an enthusiast of financial markets and the solutions they offer. Professionally, I am associated with the traditional ones, but I discover the power of Defi and the possibilities it brings. The fascination with blockchain led me to start my adventure with programming. I am a graduate of the bootcamp (at FutureCollars) in the frontend subject, and at the same time I use the available educational tools, such as FreeCodeCamp and all available applications to expand my knowledge and discover the layers of my patience;). I will want to associate the beginning of my career in the industry with this technology.
